#INI4 solution

a = 100
b = 200
output = 0

for numbers in range(a, b + 1):
    if a % 2 == 1:
         output = output + numbers

print(output)


#I forgot to upload the solution to Github and didn´t save my code as well.
#So I tried to solve it again, but like you can see I don´t have the exact values anymore I used.
#I think this code should work!
#But for some reason it doesn´t when I run it. My output always remains 0.

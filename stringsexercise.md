I didn´t really know how to keep track of the exercises in here..
In case you meant copy and paste each answer in here, I noticed too late.
I actually did the stringsexercises, as well as the booleans, operators and the lists exercieses, because I didn´t notice the change in chapters.

I thought maybe you can check my done exercises via this link.
